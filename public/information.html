									<h2>What are Vestibular Disorders?</h2>
									<p>Vestibular disorders involve problems with your vestibular system. This body system includes structures in your inner ear and brain that help you maintain your sense of balance.
                                        A problem with the vestibular structures within your inner ear or the parts of your central nervous system (CNS) that process this information can lead to balance problems (vestibular dysfunction). Typically, vestibular issues cause symptoms like dizziness and vertigo.

                                    <p>Other symptoms depend on the specific condition or balance issues you're having:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Trouble standing or sitting upright.</li>
                                        <li>Trouble walking in a steady pattern..</li>
                                        <li>Hearing loss or ringing in your ears (tinnitus).</li>
                                        <li>Uncontrollable, irregular eye movements (nystagmus).</li>

                                    <h2>What causes Vestibular Disorders?</h2>
                                    <p>Causes of Vestibular Dysfunction include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Aging: </b>The structures within your inner ear that receive and send balance signals to your brain can deteriorate as you age.</li>
                                        <li><b>Head injuries:</b>Trauma from a head injury can damage your inner ear or parts of your brain involved in your vestibular system.</li>
                                        <li><b>Exposure to toxins: </b>Ototoxicity is when a medicine you’re taking damages your inner ear. It’s one of the most common causes of vestibular dysfunction. Chemicals in the environment (like lead) can also damage your inner ear.</li>
                                        <li><b>Inflammation: </b>Inflammation can damage the organs and nerves in your inner ear involved in balance. Sometimes, the inflammation results from a viral or bacterial infection.</li>
                                        <li><b>Problems with inner ear fluid (endolymph): </b>Fluid inside your inner ear shifts in response to your head movements. The shifting activates nerves that communicate information about your position to your brain. Problems with the fluid can disrupt the signal, causing vestibular system problems.</li>
                                        <li><b>Tumors: </b>Growths, including tumors, can impact the nerves that help you maintain your balance.</li>
                                        <li><b>Autoimmune diseases: </b>Although it’s rare, an autoimmune disease can cause your immune system to attack your inner ear.</li>
                                        <li><b>Neurological conditions: </b>Conditions that impact your nerves and CNS can disrupt your balance. Stroke is a common cause of central vestibular dysfunction.</li>

									<h2>Triggers of Vestibular Disorders</h2>
									<p>Some vestibular disorders involve episodes where you experience symptoms like dizziness and vertigo, followed by periods where you don’t experience symptoms at all. In these instances, “triggers” may start or worsen an episode. Triggers may include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Changes in your environment (like entering a “busy,” visually stimulating place).</li>
                                        <li>Sudden head movements or changes in position (like lying back in bed).</li>
                                        <li>Certain foods and drinks.</li>
                                        <li>Lack of sleep.</li>

									<h2>What are the complications of vestibular disorders?</h2>
									<p>Vestibular dysfunction doesn’t just impact your balance. Untreated vestibular conditions can lead to other things, too, like:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Falls: </b>Trouble balancing can lead to dangerous falls. According to the World Health Organization, about 20% to 30% of older people in the U.S. who fall experience serious head injuries, bruises or hip fractures. The risk of life-threatening falls is greatest in people over 60 years old.</li>
                                        <li><b>Long-term hearing loss: </b>Some vestibular disorders are also associated with long-term hearing loss. Early diagnosis and treatment can often prevent this from happening.</li>
                                        <li><b>Mental health conditions: </b>Symptoms of vestibular dysfunction can keep you from doing everyday activities like driving or even walking. Vestibular issues can cause you to avoid social interactions if you’re concerned something might trigger dizziness or a vertigo episode. The effects can lead to anxiety and depression.</li>

									<h2>Can vestibular disorders be prevented?</h2>
									<p>It depends on the cause of the vestibular disorder, but typically, vestibular disorders aren’t preventable.
                                        But there are things you can do to care for yourself. For example, you can get treated as early as possible to prevent long-term damage from causes like infections. If you’re living with a chronic (long-lasting) condition, you can take steps to reduce your risk of falls.

                                        <li><b>Hearing tests: </b>These check for signs of hearing loss or symptoms like ringing in your ear that may be related to a vestibular disorder.</li>
                                        <li><b>Videonystagmography(VNG): </b>Measure the health of nerves in your brain that control eye movements, hearing and balance. </li>
                                        <li><b>Video Head Impulse Test: </b>To assess inner ear vestibular function and to measure eye movement during head motion.</li>
                                        <li><b>Functional Head Impulse Test(FHIT): </b>To assess the function of the semicircular canals.</li>

									<h2>How are vestibular disorders treated?</h2>
									<p>Your treatment depends on the specific condition. Vestibular disorder treatments may include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Lifestyle changes: </b>Conservative treatments, like lifestyle changes, go a long way in managing several vestibular disorders. For example, if fluid buildup in your ear is an issue, reducing salty foods (which cause you to retain water) may help. So can learning to identify and manage triggers that may cause a vertigo episode.</li>
                                        <li><b>Medications: </b>You may need medicines to treat what’s causing your condition or to manage symptoms. For example, you may need antibiotics to clear bacterial infections or diuretics to reduce fluid buildup in your ear. You may need anti-nausea medications or antihistamines to manage feelings of motion sickness.</li>
                                        <li><b>Dix-Hallpike & McClure Pagnini: </b>If you have BPPV, you may work with a physical therapist to help reposition misplaced structures in your inner ear with this procedure.</li>
